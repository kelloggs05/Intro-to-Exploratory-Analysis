# Intro-to-Exploratory-Analysis
Introduction to Exploratory Analysis and improving seaborn skills.
Overview

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of roller coaster data to observe different features such as height, speed, length, and drop distances. Main objective was to improve my Seaborn abilities by creating varied visualizations in order to extract patterns and trends from the data.
Key Objectives

Preprocess and clean roller coaster data for analysis.

Discover connections between characteristics like height, speed, and drop lengths.

Utilize Seaborn to make informative and visually appealing visualizations.

Discover patterns and correlations between various roller coaster traits. 

Tools & Libraries
-Pandas: Cleaning and manipulation of data.

-NumPy: Elementary numerical computations.

-Seaborn: Producing informative and good-looking visualizations.

Matplotlib: Enhancing visualization outputs.

Visualizations Included

-Roller coaster height and speed distributions.

-Heatmaps of correlations to present correlations between different features.

-Scatter plots to show correlations between drop distance and ride time.

-Box plots comparing coaster types and their respective performance metrics.

Skills Demonstrated

-Data cleaning and preparation.

-Creating nice visualizations using Seaborn.

-Looking at roller coaster trends and patterns.
